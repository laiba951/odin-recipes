    <li>1 yellow onion <em>finely diced</em></li>
    <li>3/4 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>1/2 cup chicken broth</li>
    <li>40 oz. Marinara sauce</li>

    <h3>Lasagna</h3>
    <li>12 Lasagna noodles <em>plus extra in case of breakage</em></li>
    <li>2.5 cups Mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 9x13-inch casserole dish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <h3>Prep Work</h3>
        <li><b>Combine the cheese filling ingredients</b> in a medium bowl and set aside. Measure out remaining ingredients.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Making the Meat Sauce</h3>
        <li><b>Heat olive oil</b> over medium heat and <b>add the diced onions.</b> Let them soften for 10 minutes. (This allows them to release a little sugar which is a nice offset to the acidity of the tomatoes.)</li>
        <li><b>Add the ground beef and sausage</b> and increase heat to medium-high. Use a spatula to break up the meat so that it’s very fine and crumbled. Cook for 8-10 minutes, or until cooked through. <b>Add garlic</b> during the last minute. Drain excess grease.</li>
        <li><b>Add the chicken broth</b> and use a silicone spatula to “clean” the bottom and sides of the pot. <b>Add the marinara sauce, tomato paste, hot sauce, and Worcestershire sauce</b>. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partially and let the sauce simmer gently while you boil the pasta noodles.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol> 
        <h3>Preheat Oven and Cook Lasagna Noodles</h3>
        <li>Preheat oven to <b>375°</b>.</li>
        <li><b>Begin boiling a large pot of salted pasta water</b> for the lasagna noodles. Once a rapid boil is reached, <b>cook the noodles to al dente</b> according to package instructions. (Set a timer to ensure you don’t overcook them.) Gently stir with a wooden spoon throughout cooking to prevent the noodles from sticking. <b>Drain and rinse with cold water</b> until noodles are completely cool.</li>
        <li>Lay the cooled noodles flat on wax or parchment paper while you begin assembling the lasagna.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <li><b>Spread 1 heaping cup of meat sauce</b> on the bottom of a 9 x 13-inch casserole dish. Next, add 4 lasagna noodles, overlapping them if needed.</li>
        <li><b>Spread 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture</b> over the noodles, followed by about <b>1 ½ cups of meat sauce.</b></li>
        <li>Top with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture, 1 ½ cups meat sauce</b>.</li>
        <li>Finish with <b>4 more lasagna noodles, the rest of the ricotta mixture, and the rest of the meat sauce.</b></li>
        <li><b>Top with 2 ½ cups of Mozzarella cheese.</b></li>
        <li><b>Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray</b> and place it spray-side-down on top of the baking dish to prevent the cheese from sticking to it.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <h3>Bake</h3>
        <li><b>Bake for 35 minutes.</b> <i>Remove cover</i> and <b>bake for 10 more minutes.</b></li>
        <li>Remove and garnish with fresh parsley. <b>Let it sit for 15 minutes prior to serving</b> to allow the layers to set. Serve with <a href="https://thecozycook.com/garlic-bread-with-cheese/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">garlic bread with cheese.</a></li>

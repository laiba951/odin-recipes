    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 oz. Penne pasta</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic <i>minced</i></li>
        <li>2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>6 oz. cream cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups baby spinach</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large pot</li>
        <li>1 deep skillet</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil to cook the pasta. Once boiling, add the pasta and <b>cook until al dente.</b> Drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce. <b>Add the butter and minced garlic to a deep skillet or pot and sauté over medium heat for 1-2 minutes,</b> or just until the garlic is soft and fragrant, but not brown.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to medium-low. <b>Add the milk to the skillet along with the cream cheese (cut into chunks).</b> Heat the milk and cream cheese while whisking, until the cream cheese has fully melted into the milk.</li>
        <li><b>Whisk in the grated Parmesan cheese and continue to whisk as the sauce comes up to a gentle simmer.</b> When it reaches a simmer, the sauce will thicken. Turn the heat down to low to keep the sauce warm. Season the sauce with 1/4 tsp salt and a generous amount of freshly cracked pepper.</li>
        <li><b>Add the fresh spinach to the sauce</b> and stir it in until it has wilted and become limp.</li>
        <li>Finally, <b>add the cooked and drained pasta to the spinach alfredo sauce</b> and stir to combine. Serve immediately.</li>
